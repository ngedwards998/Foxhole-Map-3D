# Foxhole Map 3D

[https://www.FoxholeMap3D.app](https://www.FoxholeMap3D.app)

This is a 1:1 scale (sort of) map of the MMO [Foxhole](https://www.foxholegame.com/).

Why do I say it's 'sort of' 1:1? To allow for a better user experience,
I scaled the heightmap and texture resolutions from 256x256 to 128x128. I want to make sure that people with slow computers are still able to use the website.  

Big thanks to [Derp](https://github.com/NoUDerp) for providing the heightmap. Tiles are hosted at this URL:

## How it works:

The full resolution (11264 x 12415) texture map is scaled to make its largest dimension equal to 16384, the smaller dimension is padded. The height maps is scaled to the texturemap and padded. Both are sliced into tiles at progressively smaller sizes until a full tree of tiles is built.

The mesh geometries are generated by using a quadtree to determine which tiles to render. Smaller, high-fidelity tiles are loaded as the camera gets closer to the terrain.
