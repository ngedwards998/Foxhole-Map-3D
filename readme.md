TODO:

1. Tile up the terrain with some sort of x,y system
    a. Successfully break up tiles

2. Use distance to determine which tiles to load in

3. Create quadtree tiles
    a. create quadtree of tiles

4. Create quadtree algorithm for LOD caculations
    a. Test in 2D

5. Apply distance-based LOD to mesh
    a. distance = LOD
    b. LOD = size of tile and # verts

6. Apply texturing to tiles
